# minimum lovable "Claim Pluridrop" dApp
CosmosJS + Twitter OAuth integration (does this exist already?)

- store Keplr wallet address to be used in the Pluridrop

# set up the Pluridrop
deploy the contracts for https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno-tools to the mainnet
(BONUS: make tokens nonliquid, i.e. impossible to open a secondary market for)
start 9 airdops - one for each of the $VALUES and one for $PLURALISM as such
